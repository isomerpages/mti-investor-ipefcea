<p>About the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework</p>
<p>Launched on 23 May 2022, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity
(IPEF) establishes a common platform to advance resilience, sustainability,
inclusiveness, economic growth, fairness, and competitiveness for participating
economies economies. Till date, it consists of 14 partners, namely Australia,
Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Four pillars of cooperation, comprising:</p>
<p>(i) Trade: IPEF partners will seek to develop high-standard, inclusive,
free, fair and open trade commitments that build upon the rules-based multilateral
trading system and develop new and creative approaches in trade and technology
policies in the areas of: labour, the environment, the digital economy,
agriculture, transparency and good regulatory practices, trade facilitation,
inclusivity, and technical assistance and economic cooperation.</p>
<p>(ii) Supply chains: Commit to improving transparency, diversity, security,
and sustainability in our supply chains to make them more resilient and
well integrated. The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement is the first multi-country
arrangement to strengthen the resilience and connectivity of supply chains
through collective and individual actions. To advance cooperation, three
coordination bodies will be set-up: (a) a Supply Chain Council that will
develop sector-specific action plans to strengthen resilience in critical
sectors and key goods; (b) a Crisis Response Network to facilitate emergency
communications&nbsp; and coordination between governments during supply
chain disruptions; and (c) a tripartite labour rights advisory board that
will help promote labour rights in IPEF countriesâ€™ supply chains.</p>
<p>(iii) Clean energy, decarbonization and infrastructure: IPEF partners
will seek to advance cooperation to accelerate the research development
and deployment of clean energy technologies, policy frameworks, capacity
building, technical assistance, financing, platforms in areas of: energy
security and transition; greenhouse gas emissions reductions in priority
sectors; sustainable land, water and ocean solutions; innovative technologies
for greenhouse gas removal, to decarbonize economies and build resilience
to climate impacts.</p>
<p>(iv) Tax and Anti-Corruption: IPEF partners will seek to implement and
accelerate progress on anti-corruption measures, fair competition and tax
initiatives within our domestic legal frameworks, consistent with international
agreements and standards applicable to each IPEF partner based on respective
commitments.</p>
