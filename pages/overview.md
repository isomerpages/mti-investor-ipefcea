<p>Under the IPEF Clean Economy Agreement, the IPEF partners agreed to establish
an annual IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum beginning in 2024 to help match
capital to climate-critical projects to advance decarbonisation and transition
to net-zero economies. The Investor Forum seeks to catalyse sustainable
infrastructure and climate technology investments across IPEF economies
that are party to the Clean Economy Agreement. The U.S. envisions the Investor
Forum bringing together the region’s largest investors, innovative start-up
entrepreneurs, cutting-edge project proponents, and government agencies
for matchmaking and investment facilitation. At the U.S.’ invitation, Singapore
has agreed to host the inaugural Investor Forum on 6 June 2024. Singapore’s
Ministry of Trade and Industry is leading the organisation of the event
in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the other 12
IPEF partner governments.</p>
