<p>Climate change poses an existential crisis and urgent action is needed
to mitigate the rising greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, many
sustainable projects and innovative green technologies have emerged to
address this concern, and there is tremendous potential to expand and scale
up their deployment. The IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum is a unique
platform that aims to strengthen international cooperation in the clean
economy to facilitate access to capital, mitigate risks, expand markets,
align policy priorities and deliver shared benefits. By bringing together
the region's largest investors, start-up entrepreneurs, project developers
and key government representatives, the forum aims to align financial objectives
with environmental goals, and bridge the gap between available capital
and critical projects. Through this event, we will build connections between
the public and private sectors, facilitate insightful conversations with
esteemed panellists, and enable high quality business and capital matchmaking.
Join us in championing sustainability through strategic investments in
the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
