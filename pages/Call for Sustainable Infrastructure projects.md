<p>As part of the inaugural IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum, we are holding
a sustainable infrastructure call, run by PwC Singapore, that aims to showcase
sustainable infrastructure projects in the 14 IPEF economies and connect
them with global investors. Projects for consideration are: (i) those which
are ready for investment in the next 18 months (“ready projects”); and
(ii) those that are in pre-business case (“pipeline projects”). Infrastructure
projects in any sector will be eligible as long as the project advances
the objectives of the IPEF Clean Economy Agreement. Shortlisted project
proponents would be invited to pitch their concepts to global investors
at the Investor Forum in Singapore on 5-6 June. To participate, project
proponents are encouraged to get in touch with their respective IPEF government
representatives. Nominations are open until 26<sup> </sup>April 2024.</p>
